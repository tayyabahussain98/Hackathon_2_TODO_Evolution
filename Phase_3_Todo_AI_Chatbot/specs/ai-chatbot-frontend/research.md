### Decision: Determined ShadCN implementation
### Rationale: Analyzed existing component styling patterns
### Findings:
- ShadCN components are already implemented with a custom theme
- Components use the standard ShadCN pattern with cn utility for class composition
- Theme configuration is in `frontend/lib/utils.js` and `frontend/components/ui/` directory

## 5. API Integration Patterns

### Decision: Confirmed existing API patterns
### Rationale: Reviewed current API communication methods
### Findings:
- API calls use fetch with Authorization headers
- Error handling follows try/catch patterns
- Loading states are managed with React state
- JWT tokens are retrieved from auth context
