# AI Chatbot Frontend - Tasks

## Feature Overview
Implement a frontend AI chatbot interface that connects to the backend /api/chat endpoint using OpenAI ChatKit, with ShadCN styling and JWT authentication.

## Implementation Strategy
- MVP: Basic chat interface that connects to the backend API
- Incremental delivery: Start with core functionality, then add UI enhancements and navigation
- Independent testing: Each user story should be testable on its own

## Dependencies
- Backend `/api/chat` endpoint must be operational
- Existing authentication system with JWT support
- ShadCN components must be properly configured

## Parallel Execution Examples
- UI component styling can be done in parallel with API integration
- Sidebar integration can be done in parallel with chat page development
- Testing can be done in parallel with implementation
