# AI Chatbot Frontend - Implementation Plan

## 1. Technical Context

### Project Structure
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (app router)
- **Styling**: ShadCN/ui components
- **Authentication**: Existing JWT-based auth system
- **Backend API**: `/api/chat` endpoint (already implemented)
- **Target Path**: `frontend/app/chatbot/page.tsx`

### Dependencies
- **OpenAI ChatKit**: For chat interface components
- **ShadCN Components**: Card, Input, Button, Spinner, Avatar
- **Existing Auth Context**: For JWT token access

### Unknowns
- **Auth Context Location**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION - Where is the existing auth context/hook located?
- **Sidebar Component Path**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION - What is the exact path of the sidebar component to update?
- **Current Styling Approach**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION - How are ShadCN components currently configured and themed?

## 2. Constitution Check

Based on the project constitution, this implementation must:
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Use established authentication mechanisms
- Apply consistent styling with ShadCN components
- Ensure security by properly handling JWT tokens
- Maintain performance standards

### Compliance Status
- ✅ Will use existing auth system
- ✅ Will maintain existing UI patterns
- ✅ Will follow security best practices
- ⚠️ Need to verify performance impact of new dependencies

## 3. Gates

### Gate 1: Architecture Alignment
- [ ] Confirmed: New page follows Next.js app router patterns
- [ ] Confirmed: Integration with existing auth system
- [ ] To Verify: Minimal impact on bundle size with new dependencies

### Gate 2: Security Compliance
- [ ] To Verify: JWT tokens handled securely (no client-side storage vulnerabilities)
- [ ] To Verify: API communication follows HTTPS best practices
- [ ] To Verify: No sensitive data exposed in client-side code

### Gate 3: Performance Impact
- [ ] To Verify: OpenAI ChatKit bundle size acceptable
- [ ] To Verify: Page load times remain acceptable
- [ ] To Verify: Memory usage during chat sessions

## 4. Phase 0: Research & Resolution

### 4.1 Research Tasks
- Locate existing auth context/hook implementation
- Identify sidebar component location and update mechanism
- Assess current ShadCN configuration and theming
- Evaluate OpenAI ChatKit integration patterns
- Review existing API integration patterns

### 4.2 Dependency Analysis
- OpenAI ChatKit: Compatibility with Next.js app router
- Bundle size impact assessment
- Integration with existing styling system

## 5. Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### 5.1 Implementation Phases
- **Phase A**: Create Chatbot Page with basic ChatKit integration
- **Phase B**: Connect to Backend API with authentication
- **Phase C**: Customize UI components and styling
- **Phase D**: Integrate with sidebar navigation
- **Phase E**: Add authentication protection
- **Phase F**: Testing and polish

### 5.2 Success Criteria
- Page loads with functional chat interface
- Messages sent/received correctly with backend
- Proper authentication handling
- Consistent UI/UX with existing application
- Responsive design for mobile compatibility
