  ## AI Todo Chatbot – Frontend Specification

  ### 1. Overview This specification covers **only the frontend** part of AI Chatbot integration.   Backend (/api/chat endpoint) is already complete.   The frontend will add a chatbot interface using **OpenAI ChatKit** that connects to the backend /api/chat endpoint.

  ### 2. Core Requirements - Add a new chatbot page: `/chatbot` - Use **OpenAI ChatKit** for the chat UI (message bubbles, input field, send button, loading indicator) - Connect to backend POST /api/chat endpoint - Send JWT token in Authorization header (from existing auth) - Display conversation history (user and assistant messages) - Show loading spinner when message is being processed - Add "Chat with AI" option in sidebar menu to navigate to /chatbot - Keep existing todo UI and functionality unchanged

  ### 3. Chatbot Page Layout (/chatbot) - Full-screen chat interface using OpenAI ChatKit - Header: "Todo AI Assistant" or "Chat with AI" - Message area: Scrollable chat history (user messages right-aligned, assistant left-aligned) - Input area at bottom: Text input + send button - Welcome message on first load: "Hi! I'm your Todo AI assistant. How can I help you with your tasks today?" - Support natural conversation (e.g., user types "add task buy milk" → bot responds and adds task)

  ### 4. Integration with Backend - Send requests to /api/chat with:   - message: user input   - conversation_id: from previous response or null for new chat - Include JWT in headers: Authorization: Bearer  - On response: Display assistant message and update history - Handle tool_calls if returned (show confirmation like "Task added: Buy milk")

  ### 5. Sidebar Menu Update - Add new item: "Chat with AI" (icon: MessageCircle) - Links to /chatbot - Keep existing items: Home, My Tasks, About, Logout

  ### 6. Authenticated Behavior - Only accessible when logged in (redirect to /login if not) - Use existing auth context to get user_id and token

  ### 7. UI Components (ShadCN) - ChatKit for core chat (customize with ShadCN if needed) - Card for chat container - Input + Button for message input - Spinner for loading - Avatar or icon for user/assistant messages - Responsive design (mobile-friendly)

  ### 8. Dependencies - npm install openai-chatkit - Existing ShadCN components

  ### 9. Acceptance Criteria - /chatbot page loads with ChatKit UI - User can send message → loading spinner → assistant response shown - Conversation history persists on page refresh (via backend DB) - Sidebar has "Chat with AI" option - Existing todo functionality unchanged - JWT sent correctly to /api/chat - No security leaks (token handled properly)

  This specification is complete for frontend only. Next step: Generate speckit.plan-frontend

# AI Chatbot Frontend - Specification

## 1. Overview
This specification covers the **frontend** implementation of an AI Chatbot interface that integrates with the existing backend `/api/chat` endpoint. The feature will add a new chatbot page accessible via a sidebar menu item, providing users with an AI assistant for todo management tasks using natural language commands.

## 2. User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Flows:
- **Scenario 1**: User navigates to the chatbot page from the sidebar and starts a conversation with the AI assistant
- **Scenario 2**: User types a natural language command (e.g., "add task buy groceries") and receives an AI response confirming the action
- **Scenario 3**: User views conversation history with both their messages and AI responses
- **Scenario 4**: User continues a conversation across multiple interactions with context maintained

### Testing Scenarios:
- User can successfully navigate to the chatbot page
- Messages are sent to the backend and responses are displayed
- Loading indicators appear during message processing
- Conversation history is maintained during the session
- JWT authentication is properly passed to backend requests

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Navigation Requirements:
- **REQ-NAV-001**: Add a "Chat with AI" menu item in the sidebar navigation
- **REQ-NAV-002**: The menu item should link to the `/chatbot` route
- **REQ-NAV-003**: The menu item should use a MessageCircle icon
- **REQ-NAV-004**: Maintain all existing sidebar items (Home, My Tasks, About, Logout)

### 3.2 Chat Interface Requirements:
- **REQ-CHAT-001**: Create a `/chatbot` page with a full-screen chat interface using OpenAI ChatKit
- **REQ-CHAT-002**: Display a welcome message on first load: "Hi! I'm your Todo AI assistant. How can I help you with your tasks today?"
- **REQ-CHAT-003**: Show message bubbles with user messages right-aligned and assistant messages left-aligned
- **REQ-CHAT-004**: Include a text input field and send button at the bottom of the screen
- **REQ-CHAT-005**: Display a loading spinner when a message is being processed

### 3.3 Backend Integration Requirements:
- **REQ-API-001**: Send POST requests to `/api/chat` with message and conversation_id
- **REQ-API-002**: Include JWT token in Authorization header: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **REQ-API-003**: Handle responses from the backend and display assistant messages
- **REQ-API-004**: Manage conversation_id for maintaining context across messages

### 3.4 Authentication Requirements:
- **REQ-AUTH-001**: The `/chatbot` page should only be accessible when logged in
- **REQ-AUTH-002**: Redirect to `/login` if user is not authenticated
- **REQ-AUTH-003**: Use existing auth context to retrieve user token

### 3.5 UI Component Requirements:
- **REQ-COMP-001**: Use ShadCN components for styling (Card, Input, Button, Spinner)
- **REQ-COMP-002**: Implement responsive design that works on mobile devices
- **REQ-COMP-003**: Use appropriate avatars or icons to distinguish user and assistant messages

## 4. Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics:
- Users can access the chatbot page within 2 clicks from any other page
- Messages appear in the chat interface within 3 seconds of submission
- 95% of message submissions result in successful responses
- Page loads in under 2 seconds on standard broadband connection
- Mobile interface is usable on screens as small as 320px width

### Qualitative Measures:
- Users can successfully interact with the AI assistant to manage their todos
- Conversation flow feels natural and intuitive
- Visual distinction between user and AI messages is clear
- Loading states provide adequate feedback during processing
- Navigation remains consistent with existing application patterns

## 5. Key Entities
- **Conversation**: Maintains context between user and AI assistant
- **Message**: Individual user or assistant communication units
- **AuthToken**: JWT token for authenticated API requests
- **SidebarMenuItem**: Navigation item for accessing the chatbot

## 6. Assumptions
- Backend `/api/chat` endpoint is operational and follows the specified API contract
- Existing authentication system provides JWT tokens accessible to frontend
- OpenAI ChatKit is compatible with the current Next.js application
- User's browser supports modern JavaScript and WebSocket connections
- Network connectivity is sufficient for real-time chat interactions

## 7. Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing todo functionality
- Cannot modify backend API contract or authentication mechanisms
- UI must follow existing application styling patterns
- All user data must be transmitted securely with proper authentication

## 8. Dependencies
- OpenAI ChatKit library for chat interface components
- Existing authentication context and JWT token management
- Backend `/api/chat` endpoint with MCP tool integration
- ShadCN component library for UI elements
