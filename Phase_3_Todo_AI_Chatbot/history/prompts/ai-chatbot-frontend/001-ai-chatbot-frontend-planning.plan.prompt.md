  ## AI Todo Chatbot – Frontend Implementation Plan

  ### 1. Objective
  Add a beautiful, user-friendly AI chatbot interface to the existing frontend.
  The chatbot will connect to the backend /api/chat endpoint (already complete).
  Use OpenAI ChatKit for the core chat UI, ShadCN for styling, and integrate with existing auth (JWT).

  ### 2. Prerequisites
  - Install OpenAI ChatKit in frontend folder:

  npm install openai-chatkit

  text

  - Ensure existing auth context provides JWT and user info
  - Add /chatbot to sidebar menu (already there or add)

  ### 3. Step-by-Step Phases

  **Phase A: Create Chatbot Page**
  - Create frontend/app/chatbot/page.tsx
  - Import OpenAI ChatKit components
  - Set up basic ChatKit instance:
  - backendUrl: "/api/chat"
  - headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${token}` }
  - Show loading state on first load
  - Display welcome message: "Hi! I'm your Todo AI assistant. How can I help you with your tasks today?"
  - Acceptance: Page loads with chat UI and welcome message

  **Phase B: Connect to Backend**
  - Use existing auth hook/context to get token
  - Send POST requests to /api/chat with:
  - message: user input
  - conversation_id: from previous response or null
  - Handle response:
  - Display assistant message
  - Update conversation history
  - Show loading spinner during API call
  - Acceptance: User types message → spinner → assistant reply appears

  **Phase C: Message Rendering & Styling**
  - Customize ChatKit messages:
  - User messages: right-aligned, blue background
  - Assistant messages: left-aligned, gray background
  - Use ShadCN Avatar for user/assistant icons
  - Add typing indicator for assistant
  - Scroll to bottom on new message
  - Acceptance: Messages look clean and modern

  **Phase D: Sidebar Integration**
  - Update sidebar component (likely layout or sidebar.tsx)
  - Add new menu item: "Chat with AI" (icon: MessageCircle)
  - Link to /chatbot
  - Keep existing items (Home, My Tasks, About, Logout)
  - Acceptance: Sidebar has Chat with AI option and navigates correctly

  **Phase E: Auth Protection**
  - Wrap /chatbot page with auth check (redirect to /login if not authenticated)
  - Use existing auth guard/hook
  - Acceptance: Unauthenticated user cannot access /chatbot

  **Phase F: Testing & Polish**
  - Test full flow:
  - Login → go to /chatbot
  - Send "add task buy milk" → task added in DB
  - Send "list my tasks" → shows list
  - Refresh page → conversation history loads
  - Add subtle animations (ShadCN transitions)
  - Mobile responsive check
  - Acceptance: Chatbot works end-to-end, no breakage in existing todo UI

  ### 4. Final Folder Additions

  frontend/ └── app/chatbot/ └── page.tsx

  text

  ### 5. Acceptance Criteria (Frontend Complete When)
  - /chatbot page loads with ChatKit UI
  - Messages send to /api/chat and display responses
  - Conversation history persists
  - Sidebar has "Chat with AI" option
  - Auth protection works
  - Existing todo functionality unchanged
  - UI looks modern and consistent with ShadCN

  This plan is complete for frontend only.

# AI Chatbot Frontend - Implementation Plan

## 1. Technical Context

### Project Structure
- **Frontend Framework**: Next.js (app router)
- **Styling**: ShadCN/ui components
- **Authentication**: Existing JWT-based auth system
- **Backend API**: `/api/chat` endpoint (already implemented)
- **Target Path**: `frontend/app/chatbot/page.tsx`

### Dependencies
- **OpenAI ChatKit**: For chat interface components
- **ShadCN Components**: Card, Input, Button, Spinner, Avatar
- **Existing Auth Context**: For JWT token access

### Unknowns
- **Auth Context Location**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION - Where is the existing auth context/hook located?
- **Sidebar Component Path**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION - What is the exact path of the sidebar component to update?
- **Current Styling Approach**: NEEDS CLARIFICATION - How are ShadCN components currently configured and themed?

## 2. Constitution Check

Based on the project constitution, this implementation must:
- Follow existing code patterns and architecture
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Use established authentication mechanisms
- Apply consistent styling with ShadCN components
- Ensure security by properly handling JWT tokens
- Maintain performance standards

### Compliance Status
- ✅ Will use existing auth system
- ✅ Will maintain existing UI patterns
- ✅ Will follow security best practices
- ⚠️ Need to verify performance impact of new dependencies

## 3. Gates

### Gate 1: Architecture Alignment
- [ ] Confirmed: New page follows Next.js app router patterns
- [ ] Confirmed: Integration with existing auth system
- [ ] To Verify: Minimal impact on bundle size with new dependencies

### Gate 2: Security Compliance
- [ ] To Verify: JWT tokens handled securely (no client-side storage vulnerabilities)
- [ ] To Verify: API communication follows HTTPS best practices
- [ ] To Verify: No sensitive data exposed in client-side code

### Gate 3: Performance Impact
- [ ] To Verify: OpenAI ChatKit bundle size acceptable
- [ ] To Verify: Page load times remain acceptable
- [ ] To Verify: Memory usage during chat sessions

## 4. Phase 0: Research & Resolution

### 4.1 Research Tasks
- Locate existing auth context/hook implementation
- Identify sidebar component location and update mechanism
- Assess current ShadCN configuration and theming
- Evaluate OpenAI ChatKit integration patterns
- Review existing API integration patterns

### 4.2 Dependency Analysis
- OpenAI ChatKit: Compatibility with Next.js app router
- Bundle size impact assessment
- Integration with existing styling system

## 5. Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### 5.1 Implementation Phases
- **Phase A**: Create Chatbot Page with basic ChatKit integration
- **Phase B**: Connect to Backend API with authentication
- **Phase C**: Customize UI components and styling
- **Phase D**: Integrate with sidebar navigation
- **Phase E**: Add authentication protection
- **Phase F**: Testing and polish

### 5.2 Success Criteria
- Page loads with functional chat interface
- Messages sent/received correctly with backend
- Proper authentication handling
