# AI Todo Chatbot Backend Tasks

## Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response

Generated comprehensive task list for AI Todo Chatbot Backend implementation at `specs/1-ai-todo-chatbot-backend/tasks.md`. The tasks are organized according to the user stories from the specification:

- Total task count: 46 tasks
- Task breakdown by user story:
  - User Story 1 (AI-Powered Todo Management): 14 tasks
  - User Story 2 (Conversation Persistence): 7 tasks
  - User Story 3 (MCP Tool Integration): 7 tasks
  - Setup and Foundational tasks: 10 tasks
  - Polish and cross-cutting tasks: 8 tasks

The tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs, parallel markers ([P]), and user story labels ([US1], [US2], [US3]). Each task includes specific file paths and clear action descriptions.

The implementation strategy allows for:
- Parallel execution opportunities where tasks don't depend on each other
- Independent testing of each user story
- MVP approach starting with User Story 1
- Clear dependencies and execution order

All tasks are specific enough for an LLM to complete them without additional context, following the constitutional requirements for the AI Todo Chatbot project.
