# Create Implementation Plan for Enhanced Todo Features

## Prompt

Create an implementation plan for intermediate and advanced todo features including priorities, tags, search & filter, sort, due dates, recurring tasks, and browser notifications.

## Response

Successfully created comprehensive implementation plan with:
- Technical Context section filled with specific technologies (Python 3.11, TypeScript 5.x, FastAPI, Next.js, etc.)
- Constitution Check section with compliance verification for layer separation, architecture, security, and database requirements
- Project Structure section with detailed file layout for both backend and frontend
- Research document with decisions on database schema, technology choices, and performance considerations
- Data model document with detailed entity definitions and validation rules
- API contract document with request/response models and endpoint specifications
- Quickstart guide for developers
- Agent context updated with new technology stack

## Outcome

The implementation plan is complete and ready for the next phase (task breakdown). All required documentation has been created following the spec-driven workflow, and the constitution compliance check has been passed. The plan covers both Phase 1 (intermediate features) and Phase 2 (advanced features) with proper architecture separation and technology alignment.
