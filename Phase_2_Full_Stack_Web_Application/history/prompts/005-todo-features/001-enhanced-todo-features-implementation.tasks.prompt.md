# Enhanced Todo Features Implementation

## Summary

Successfully completed implementation of intermediate and advanced features for the todo application. The implementation includes priorities (High/Medium/Low), tags/categories, search & filter functionality, sort capabilities, due dates with date/time picker, recurring tasks (daily/weekly/monthly), and backend logic for recurring task generation.

## Implementation Details

### Completed Features

1. **Priority Management**: Added priority selection (High/Medium/Low) with visual indicators and sorting capability
2. **Tag Management**: Implemented multi-select tags input with filtering capability
3. **Search & Filter**: Added full-text search and combined filtering by status, priority, tags, and recurrence
4. **Sort Tasks**: Comprehensive sorting by priority, due date, creation date, and description with asc/desc toggle
5. **Due Date Management**: Date/time picker for due dates with overdue task visual styling
6. **Recurring Tasks**: Recurrence patterns (daily, weekly, monthly) with automatic next instance generation when completed

### Technical Implementation

- **Database**: Added new columns to todos table via Alembic migration (priority, tags, due_date, recurrence_type, reminder_time)
- **Backend**: Updated SQLAlchemy models, Pydantic schemas, API endpoints, and service layer with new functionality
- **Frontend**: Enhanced components with new UI elements, filtering controls, and proper state management
- **API**: Extended endpoints with query parameters for search, filter, and sort operations

## Files Modified

- Updated backend models and schemas to support new fields
- Enhanced API routes with filtering and sorting capabilities
- Modified service layer with business logic for new features
- Updated frontend components for new functionality
- Created and executed database migration

## Validation

All features have been implemented and tested. The application maintains user-specific scoping and integrates with existing authentication system. Performance considerations have been addressed with proper database indexing.

## Outcome

The todo application now supports all requested intermediate and advanced features with a clean, modern UI and robust backend implementation. All 66 tasks from the task breakdown have been completed successfully.
