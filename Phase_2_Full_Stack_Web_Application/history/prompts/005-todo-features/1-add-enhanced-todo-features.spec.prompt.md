# Add Enhanced Todo Features

## Prompt

(Updated for Additional Features)

## Project: Full-Stack Todo System
**Phase Focus: Add Intermediate & Advanced Features to Existing Todo App**

### 1. Overview
We already have the basic level features implemented (add, delete, update, view list, mark complete) with authentication, user-specific todos, and database persistence.
Now we will progressively add **Intermediate** and **Advanced** features as per the provided progression.

### 2. Core Requirements (Already Implemented – Recap)
- Add Task
- Delete Task
- Update Task
- View Task List
- Mark as Complete
- User authentication (email/password + Google OAuth)
- User-specific todos (scoped by user_id)

### 3. Intermediate Level Features (Priority: High – Add Now)

| Feature                  | Description                                      | UI Elements (ShadCN)                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Priorities               | Assign High/Medium/Low to each task              | Select or Badge                          |
| Tags/Categories          | Add labels like work/home/personal               | Multi-select or Chips                    |
| Search & Filter          | Search by keyword; filter by status/priority/tag | Input + Dropdowns                        |
| Sort Tasks               | Sort by priority, due date (if added), alpha     | Dropdown (Sort by...)                    |

### 4. Advanced Level Features (Priority: Medium – Add After Intermediate)

| Feature                  | Description                                      | UI Elements                              |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Due Dates                | Set deadline date/time for tasks                 | DatePicker + TimePicker                  |
| Recurring Tasks          | Repeat daily/weekly/monthly                      | Select (Recurrence: none/daily/weekly)   |
| Time Reminders           | Browser notifications 10 min before due          | Notification API (if permitted)          |

### 5. Out of Scope (This Phase)
- Calendar integration
- Shared lists/collaboration
- File attachments
- Voice input

### 6. Architecture Constraints
- All features must be user-specific (WHERE user_id = ?)
- Backend: Add fields to Todo model (priority, tags, due_date, recurrence)
- Frontend: Update TodoItem, TodoList, AddTodoForm with new fields
- Database: Alembic migration for new columns
- Keep ShadCN/UI for all new components

### 7. Acceptance Criteria
- Intermediate features fully functional and user-scoped
- Advanced features optional but ready for demo
- No performance degradation
- Search/filter/sort work correctly
- Due dates show countdown or color coding (e.g., red if overdue)

Next step: Generate speckit.plan using auth-agent (for DB changes) and frontend-agent (for UI updates).

## Response

Created feature specification for enhanced todo features including priorities, tags, search, sort, due dates, recurring tasks, and time reminders. The specification covers functional requirements, user scenarios, success criteria, and key entities while maintaining focus on user value and business needs. The spec is ready for planning and implementation.

## Outcome

Successfully created a comprehensive feature specification document at specs/005-todo-features/spec.md with all required sections including functional requirements, user scenarios, success criteria, and assumptions. Also created a quality checklist at specs/005-todo-features/checklists/requirements.md to validate the specification completeness.
