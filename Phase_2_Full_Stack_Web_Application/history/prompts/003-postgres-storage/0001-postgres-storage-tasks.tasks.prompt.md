## Prompt

$ARGUMENTS

## Response snapshot

Generated tasks.md at specs/003-postgres-storage/tasks.md with:

**6 Phases**:
- Phase 1: Setup (T001-T002) - Verify dependencies and database configuration
- Phase 2: Foundational (T003-T006) - Database connection, ORM model, Alembic setup
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Persistent Todo Storage (P1) (T007-T020) - Core CRUD with database persistence (MVP)
- Phase 4: User Story 2 - Data Integrity and Validation (P2) (T021-T024) - Verification of validation constraints
- Phase 5: User Story 3 - Audit Trail for Todos (P3) (T025-T027) - Verification of timestamp behavior
- Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (T028-T032) - Comprehensive testing and validation

**Total Tasks**: 32

**Task Distribution**:
- Setup: 2 tasks
- Foundational: 4 tasks
- User Story 1 (MVP): 14 tasks (including migration)
- User Story 2: 4 tasks (verification only, no code changes)
- User Story 3: 3 tasks (verification only, no code changes)
- Polish: 5 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities Identified**:
- T004 (ORM model) can run parallel with T005-T006 (Alembic config)
- T009-T010 (service functions) can run parallel within US1
- T015-T020 (all route handler updates) can run parallel
- T021-T024 (US2 validation) can run parallel
- T025-T027 (US3 verification) can run parallel
- T029-T032 (polish tasks) can run parallel

**Key Observations**:
- User Stories 2 and 3 require NO code changes - only verification of existing constraints from T004 and existing Pydantic models
- All validation and timestamp behavior already implemented by T004 (SQLAlchemy model) and existing Pydantic models
- Manual commands documented: `alembic revision --autogenerate` and `alembic upgrade head`
- API contract maintained via existing Pydantic TodoResponse model (no breaking changes)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive task list for PostgreSQL database integration, organized by user story for independent implementation and testing
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (manual testing only per specification)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/003-postgres-storage/tasks.md (32 tasks across 6 phases)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story following Spec-Driven Development methodology. MVP scope is clearly User Story 1 only (14 tasks including migration). US2 and US3 require only verification, no code changes. All tasks follow required checklist format with [P] marker, [Story] labels, IDs, and file paths. Manual migration commands explicitly documented.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (task generation phase)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.implement to execute the tasks
