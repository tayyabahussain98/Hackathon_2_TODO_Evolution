## Prompt

workflow-orchestrator: Follow instructions exactly.

The speckit.specify for PostgreSQL database integration is already approved (single todos table, SQLAlchemy ORM, Alembic migrations, python-dotenv for config, and strict rule: NEVER access, read, display, or mention the contents of the .env file).

Now proceed to the next step in the pipeline:

Use the database-agent as the lead agent. Collaborate with the schema-agent for the model definition and the migration-agent for Alembic setup.

Generate a complete and detailed speckit.plan based only on the approved specification.

The plan must include: - Dependency installation (uv add commands) - Creation of core/database.py for engine, SessionLocal, and get_db dependency - Creation of models/todo.py with SQLAlchemy Base and Todo model - Alembic initialization and configuration - Initial migration generation and application steps - Updating services/todo_service.py to use database sessions for all CRUD operations - Final folder structure - Clear step-by-step phases with acceptance criteria for each - Manual commands the user needs to run (e.g., alembic revision, alembic upgrade)

Rules: - Output ONLY the speckit.plan in clean Markdown format - Do NOT generate any code snippets, tasks, or implementation yet - Do NOT touch, read, reference, or mention the .env file or its contents at any point - Wait for my explicit approval before moving to tasks or code

Start generating the speckit.plan now.

## Response snapshot

Generated speckit.plan at specs/003-postgres-storage/plan.md with:

**Architecture Decisions:**
- SQLAlchemy async ORM (over synchronous alternatives)
- Alembic for migrations (de facto standard for SQLAlchemy)
- Separate database module (core/database.py) for clean separation
- Coexistence of Pydantic models (API) and SQLAlchemy models (persistence)

**7 Implementation Phases:**
1. Phase 1: Database Infrastructure Setup (core/database.py with engine, SessionLocal, get_db)
2. Phase 2: SQLAlchemy Model Definition (models/database_todo.py)
3. Phase 3: Alembic Configuration (update alembic/env.py)
4. Phase 4: Initial Migration (alembic revision --autogenerate + alembic upgrade head)
5. Phase 5: Service Layer Migration (rewrite todo_service.py with async database operations)
6. Phase 6: Route Layer Updates (inject get_db dependency into routes)
7. Phase 7: Testing and Validation (manual testing with curl/frontend)

**Manual Commands Required:**
- `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial todos table creation"`
- `alembic upgrade head`
- `uvicorn main:app --reload` (for testing)

**Final Folder Structure:**
- core/database.py (new)
- models/database_todo.py (new)
- services/todo_service.py (updated)
- routes/todos.py (updated)
- alembic/versions/ (new migration file)

**Risks Identified:**
1. Database connection failure on startup
2. Migration conflicts with existing database
3. Breaking frontend API contract
4. Async/await errors in service layer
5. Performance degradation with large dataset

All requirements from spec.md addressed with clear acceptance criteria per phase.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive implementation plan for PostgreSQL database integration, maintaining API compatibility with existing frontend
- 🧪 Tests: N/A (planning phase)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/003-postgres-storage/plan.md (complete implementation plan)
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate actionable tasks based on this plan
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan follows agent collaboration pattern (database-agent lead, schema-agent and migration-agent support). Clear separation of database module (core/database.py) from existing config. Manual migration commands explicitly documented. No .env file access or content references included.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (planning phase)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks from this plan
