## Prompt

## Project: Full-Stack Todo System
**Phase Focus: Backend-Only Specification (No Auth, FastAPI-Based)**

### 1. Overview
A modular backend for the Todo application using FastAPI, with no authentication.
This specification covers **only the backend layer** in a dedicated folder. The backend will handle basic CRUD operations for todos without user-specific scoping (all todos are global since no auth).
Project will be initialized step-by-step in a separate `backend/` folder using UV package manager for easy verification.

### 2. User Stories (Backend Perspective)

- As an API client, I want to perform CRUD operations on Todo items via RESTful endpoints so that I can manage tasks easily.
- As a developer, I want a simple, modular FastAPI structure with clear separation between routes, services, and models for maintainability.
- As a tester, I want step-by-step implementation to verify each part (e.g., routes, services) independently.

### 3. Core Features (Backend Scope – No Auth)

| Feature                  | HTTP Method | Endpoint                | Description                                      |
|--------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Create Todo              | POST        | /api/todos              | Add a new todo item (description required)       |
| List Todos               | GET         | /api/todos              | Retrieve all todos                               |
| Get Single Todo          | GET         | /api/todos/{id}         | Retrieve a specific todo by ID                   |
| Update Todo              | PATCH       | /api/todos/{id}         | Update description or completion status          |
| Delete Todo              | DELETE      | /api/todos/{id}         | Permanently remove a todo                        |
| Health Check             | GET         | /health                 | Basic server status                              |

### 4. Data Model (Todo Item)

```json
{
  "id": int (auto-generated),
  "description": string (required, max 500 chars),
  "completed": boolean (default: false),
  "created_at": datetime,
  "updated_at": datetime
}
```

### 5-10. [Additional sections with functional requirements, non-functional requirements, architecture constraints, out of scope, acceptance criteria, and approved dependencies]

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive Backend Todo API specification with:

**Branch**: `001-backend-todo-api`
**Spec File**: `specs/001-backend-todo-api/spec.md`

**4 User Stories** (prioritized P1-P3):
1. Create and View Todos (P1) - Core CRUD MVP
2. Update Todo Status (P2) - Task modification
3. Delete Todos (P3) - Cleanup functionality
4. Health Check Monitoring (P1) - Operational readiness

**15 Functional Requirements** covering:
- 6 REST endpoints (POST, GET, GET by ID, PATCH, DELETE, Health)
- Input validation (non-empty, max 500 chars)
- HTTP status codes (201, 200, 204, 400, 404, 500)
- Auto-generated IDs and timestamps
- Error response formatting

**8 Success Criteria** (all measurable and technology-agnostic):
- Create + retrieve in under 3 HTTP requests
- All endpoints respond correctly
- Health check under 100ms
- Invalid requests return 4xx in under 500ms
- Handles 100 sequential operations
- Immediate list visibility after creation
- Delete results in 404 for subsequent ops
- Server starts in under 3 seconds

**Quality Validation**: Created and passed comprehensive checklist
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All requirements testable and unambiguous
- Success criteria technology-agnostic
- 16 acceptance scenarios across 4 user stories
- 7 edge cases identified
- Clear scope boundaries (Constraints + Out of Scope)

**Specification ready for planning phase** (`/sp.plan`)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete, testable specification for Backend Todo API establishing clear requirements and acceptance criteria for FastAPI CRUD implementation
- 🧪 Tests: No code tests (specification artifact) - 16 acceptance scenarios defined for future implementation testing
- 📁 Files: Created specs/001-backend-todo-api/spec.md (175 lines) and specs/001-backend-todo-api/checklists/requirements.md (validation checklist)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create architectural plan and design document for Backend Todo API implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances completeness with simplicity. Focus on MVP (in-memory storage, no auth) aligns with constitution's spec-driven workflow principle. All requirements are testable without implementation details, enabling independent architecture planning.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification passed all quality checks on first iteration
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Requirements checklist - PASS (14/14 items)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (standard specification creation)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Test planning phase with this spec to validate requirement clarity and completeness for architectural design
