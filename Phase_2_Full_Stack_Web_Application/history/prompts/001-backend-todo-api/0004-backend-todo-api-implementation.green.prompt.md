## Prompt

User invoked `/sp.implement` command to execute the implementation workflow for Backend Todo API.

Context:
- All checklists complete (requirements.md: 14/14 items passed)
- All prerequisites available: spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/openapi.yaml, quickstart.md, tasks.md
- 30 tasks organized into 7 phases
- MVP scope: US1 (Create/View Todos - P1) + US4 (Health Check - P1) = 19 tasks

Requirements:
- Execute all 30 tasks following phase dependencies
- Phase 2 (Foundational) blocks all user story work
- Each user story independently testable
- Manual testing via curl/Postman
- All 8 success criteria must be met

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented complete Backend Todo API with all 30 tasks completed across 7 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup (T001-T005)** - ✅ Complete
- Created backend/ folder and initialized UV project
- Created virtual environment with uv venv
- Installed FastAPI dependencies (fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, pydantic-settings)
- Created directory structure (routes/, services/, models/, core/)
- Created __init__.py files in all directories

**Phase 2: Foundational (T006-T008)** - ✅ Complete
- Created Pydantic models (TodoCreate, TodoUpdate, TodoResponse) with validation
- Created configuration settings (app_name, port, log_level) with .env support
- Initialized in-memory storage (todos list, next_id counter) in service layer

**Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create and View Todos (P1)** - ✅ Complete (MVP Component)
- Implemented service functions: create_todo(), list_todos(), get_todo()
- Created APIRouter with prefix="/api/todos"
- Implemented POST /api/todos (201 Created)
- Implemented GET /api/todos (200 OK)
- Implemented GET /api/todos/{id} (200 OK or 404)
- Created FastAPI app in main.py with router registration
- Tested all endpoints: POST creates todo with ID 1, GET lists all, GET by ID returns correct todo, 404 for non-existent IDs

**Phase 4: User Story 4 - Health Check (P1)** - ✅ Complete (MVP Component)
- Implemented GET /health endpoint returning {"status": "healthy"}
- Tested health check: 200 OK, response time ~6ms (< 100ms requirement)

**Phase 5: User Story 2 - Update Todo Status (P2)** - ✅ Complete
- Service function update_todo() already implemented with timestamp refresh
- PATCH /api/todos/{id} endpoint already implemented
- Tested: Update description only, completion only, both fields, empty description validation (400), 404 for non-existent IDs

**Phase 6: User Story 3 - Delete Todos (P3)** - ✅ Complete
- Service function delete_todo() already implemented with 404 handling
- DELETE /api/todos/{id} endpoint already implemented
- Tested: Delete returns 204, deleted ID returns 404 on subsequent operations, removed from list

**Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns (T026-T030)** - ✅ Complete
- Added logging configuration (INFO level, timestamp format)
- Added startup/shutdown event handlers with log messages
- Ran complete 11-step end-to-end workflow test (all passed)
- Verified all 8 success criteria from spec.md (all met)
- Validated quickstart.md instructions

**Project Setup**:
- Created .gitignore with Python patterns (venv, __pycache__, .env, etc.)
- All dependencies installed via UV (15 packages total)

**Testing Summary**:
- All CRUD operations work correctly
- HTTP status codes match specification (201, 200, 204, 404, 400)
- Auto-increment IDs working (starts from 1)
- Timestamps in UTC ISO 8601 format
- Validation working (empty descriptions rejected with 400)
- Error handling correct (404 for non-existent IDs)
- Health check < 6ms (well under 100ms requirement)

**Success Criteria Verification**:
- ✅ SC-001: Create + retrieve in under 3 requests (POST + GET = 2)
- ✅ SC-002: All 6 endpoints respond with correct status codes
- ✅ SC-003: Health check responds in ~6ms (< 100ms)
- ✅ SC-004: Invalid requests return 4xx with clear messages
- ✅ SC-005: Handles 100+ sequential operations
- ✅ SC-006: Created todos appear immediately in list
- ✅ SC-007: Deleted todos return 404 on all operations
- ✅ SC-008: Server starts and responds within 3 seconds

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Successfully implemented complete Backend Todo API with all 30 tasks across 7 phases, delivering full CRUD functionality with health monitoring, logging, and comprehensive testing
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing complete - 11-step end-to-end workflow passed, all user stories independently tested (US1: create/view, US2: update, US3: delete, US4: health check), all 8 success criteria verified
- 📁 Files: Created .gitignore, backend/pyproject.toml, backend/models/todo.py, backend/core/config.py, backend/services/todo_service.py, backend/routes/todos.py, backend/main.py; Updated specs/001-backend-todo-api/tasks.md (all 30 tasks marked complete)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload` to start server, test via http://localhost:8000/docs (interactive API docs), or run `/sp.git.commit_pr` to commit changes and create pull request
- 🧠 Reflection: Implementation followed spec-driven workflow perfectly. All phases completed in dependency order. MVP (US1 + US4) delivered first, then P2/P3 features added incrementally. Clean architecture maintained (routes → services → storage). All success criteria met. Ready for deployment.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all 30 tasks completed successfully, all tests passed
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All 8 Success Criteria - PASS, User Story Independence - PASS (each story tested independently), Clean Architecture - PASS (routes thin, logic in services), API Contract Compliance - PASS (OpenAPI spec matches implementation)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (standard implementation workflow)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Start server and manually test via /docs interface to verify interactive documentation, then commit changes to git and create feature branch PR
