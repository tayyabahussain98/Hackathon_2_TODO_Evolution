## Prompt

User invoked the `/sp.tasks` command to generate detailed task breakdown from the implementation plan.

Context: Implementation plan (plan.md), specification (spec.md), research (research.md), data model (data-model.md), API contracts (contracts/openapi.yaml), and quickstart guide (quickstart.md) are all complete.

Requirements:
- Generate tasks.md organized by user story for independent implementation
- Use strict checklist format: `- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Map tasks to user stories: US1 (Create and View Todos - P1), US2 (Update Todo Status - P2), US3 (Delete Todos - P3), US4 (Health Check - P1)
- Enable parallel execution where possible
- Provide MVP scope (US1 + US4 = P1 stories)
- Include dependency graph and parallel execution examples

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive tasks.md with 30 tasks organized into 7 phases:

**Phase 1: Setup** (5 tasks):
- T001-T005: Initialize UV project, create venv, install dependencies, create directory structure

**Phase 2: Foundational** (3 tasks - CRITICAL PATH):
- T006-T008: Pydantic models, configuration, in-memory storage initialization
- Blocks all user story work until complete

**Phase 3: User Story 1 - Create and View Todos (P1)** (9 tasks):
- T009-T011: Service layer functions (create_todo, list_todos, get_todo) with parallel markers [P]
- T012-T015: Route handlers (POST, GET list, GET by ID)
- T016-T017: FastAPI app setup and testing
- MVP component #1

**Phase 4: User Story 4 - Health Check Monitoring (P1)** (2 tasks):
- T018-T019: Health endpoint and testing
- MVP component #2
- Can run in parallel with US1

**Phase 5: User Story 2 - Update Todo Status (P2)** (3 tasks):
- T020-T022: Service function and PATCH endpoint with testing

**Phase 6: User Story 3 - Delete Todos (P3)** (3 tasks):
- T023-T025: Service function and DELETE endpoint with testing

**Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns** (5 tasks):
- T026-T030: Logging, event handlers, end-to-end testing, validation

**Key Decisions**:
- MVP = US1 + US4 (both P1 priorities) = 19 total tasks including setup/foundational
- 8 tasks marked [P] for parallel execution
- Each user story independently testable after completion
- Manual testing via curl/Postman (no pytest in this phase)
- Clear dependency graph showing Foundational phase blocks all stories

**Parallel Execution Examples**:
- Phase 2: All 3 foundational tasks can run in parallel (different files)
- US1 service functions: T009, T010, T011 (same file, different functions)
- MVP stories: US1 and US4 can be implemented in parallel by different developers

**Implementation Strategies Provided**:
1. MVP First: Setup → Foundational → US1 + US4 → Validate
2. Incremental Delivery: Add each story, test independently, deploy
3. Parallel Team: Multiple developers on different stories after foundational complete

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete task breakdown with 30 atomic tasks organized by user story, enabling independent implementation and testing of each story with clear MVP scope (US1 + US4)
- 🧪 Tests: No automated tests (manual testing via curl/Postman per quickstart.md) - Each user story phase includes acceptance test tasks
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md (30 tasks across 7 phases, 8 marked [P] for parallel execution)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.implement` to execute task breakdown, starting with MVP scope (Setup + Foundational + US1 + US4 = 19 tasks), or begin manual implementation following task order
- 🧠 Reflection: Task breakdown successfully maps to user stories with clear independent testability. MVP scope (US1 + US4) provides immediate value with create/view operations and health monitoring. Foundational phase correctly identified as critical blocker. Parallel opportunities maximize efficiency (8 [P] tasks). Each story checkpoint ensures incremental validation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - task generation completed successfully with proper user story organization
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): User Story Independence - PASS (each story can be tested independently), MVP Scope - PASS (US1 + US4 identified as P1 priorities), Task Granularity - PASS (30 atomic tasks with clear file paths)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (standard task generation workflow)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Execute MVP tasks (19 total) and validate each checkpoint works independently before proceeding to P2/P3 stories
