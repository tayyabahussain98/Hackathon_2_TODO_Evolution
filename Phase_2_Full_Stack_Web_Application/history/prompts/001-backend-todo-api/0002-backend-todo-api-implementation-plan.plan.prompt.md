## Prompt

## Project: Full-Stack Todo System
**Phase Focus: Backend-Only Technical Plan (No Auth, FastAPI)**

[Full user input included step-by-step initialization plan, folder structure, implementation phases A-E, error handling strategy, running instructions, and validation checklist]

Key Requirements:
- Initialize backend/ with UV package manager
- 6 REST endpoints: POST, GET (list), GET (single), PATCH, DELETE, /health
- In-memory storage with auto-increment IDs
- Pydantic models for validation
- Clean architecture: routes → services → storage
- Step-by-step testable phases
- No authentication, no database

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan with Phase 0 (Research) and Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) completed:

**Plan Document** (`plan.md`, 566 lines):
- Technical context defined (Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pydantic)
- Constitution check: PASSED all applicable principles
- Project structure designed (backend/ with routes/, services/, models/, core/)
- 5 implementation phases (A-E) with atomic, testable steps
- Error handling strategy with HTTP status code mapping
- Running instructions and validation checklist

**Phase 0: Research** (`research.md`, 6 technical decisions):
1. UV Package Manager: uv init, uv venv, uv add workflow
2. FastAPI Structure: APIRouter pattern with layer separation
3. In-Memory Storage: Module-level list with auto-increment IDs
4. Error Handling: HTTPException from service layer
5. ID Generation: Global counter, increment on create
6. Timestamps: datetime.utcnow().isoformat(), UTC, ISO 8601

**Phase 1: Design & Contracts** (3 artifacts created):

1. **data-model.md**: Complete Todo entity specification
   - 5 fields (id, description, completed, created_at, updated_at)
   - Validation rules and constraints
   - State transitions (create, update, delete)
   - Pydantic models (TodoCreate, TodoUpdate, TodoResponse)

2. **contracts/openapi.yaml**: Full OpenAPI 3.0 specification
   - 6 endpoints with request/response schemas
   - Example requests and responses
   - Error response definitions
   - All HTTP status codes documented

3. **quickstart.md**: Step-by-step setup guide
   - Prerequisites and verification
   - UV initialization steps
   - Running server instructions
   - Testing methods (Interactive Docs, curl, Postman)
   - Complete workflow test sequence
   - Troubleshooting common issues

**Implementation Phases**:
- Phase A: FastAPI skeleton with /health endpoint
- Phase B: Pydantic models (TodoCreate, TodoUpdate, TodoResponse)
- Phase C: Service layer with in-memory CRUD operations
- Phase D: Route handlers exposing service via REST
- Phase E: Logging, configuration, end-to-end testing

**Architecture Decisions**:
- Clean separation: Routes (HTTP) → Services (Logic) → Storage (In-Memory)
- No middleware needed (no auth)
- Auto-increment IDs starting from 1
- UTC timestamps in ISO 8601 format
- HTTPException for consistent error handling

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete implementation plan establishing technical architecture, atomic implementation phases, and all Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts for Backend Todo API
- 🧪 Tests: No code tests (planning artifact) - Each phase includes acceptance criteria for manual testing
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md (566 lines), research.md (6 decisions), data-model.md (entity spec), contracts/openapi.yaml (OpenAPI 3.0), quickstart.md (setup guide)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.tasks` to generate granular task breakdown from implementation phases for step-by-step execution
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan successfully balances technical detail with clarity. 5 atomic phases (A-E) provide clear progression from skeleton to complete API. Research decisions align with constitution principles (simplicity, layer separation). All artifacts complete - ready for task generation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all Phase 0 and Phase 1 artifacts generated successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Constitution Check - PASS (all applicable principles), Research completeness - PASS (6 decisions documented)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (standard planning workflow)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Generate tasks from plan phases and validate task granularity matches constitution's 2-4 hour maximum
