## Prompt

User invoked `/sp.specify` command with detailed frontend requirements for a Next.js 14 + ShadCN/UI todo application.

**Input Description**: Frontend Todo UI - A modern, responsive, single-page Todo web application built with Next.js 14 (App Router) and ShadCN/UI components. The frontend connects to the existing FastAPI backend at http://localhost:8000/api/todos. No authentication, no database work on frontend side. Project lives in dedicated frontend/ folder.

**Key Requirements from User**:
- Single page application on root route
- View all todos with status (completed or not)
- Add new todos via input form
- Toggle completion with checkbox (optimistic updates)
- Edit todo descriptions inline
- Delete todos with confirmation dialog
- Loading states (skeleton loaders)
- Error states (toasts and alerts)
- Empty state messaging
- Responsive layout (mobile to desktop)
- All UI components must use ShadCN/UI (no raw HTML elements)
- Folder structure specified: frontend/src/{app, components, lib, types}
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + lucide-react icons
- API calls centralized in lib/api.ts

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive feature specification with 5 prioritized user stories organized for independent testing and MVP delivery:

**User Stories Created**:

1. **User Story 1 - View and Add Todos (P1)**: Core MVP functionality
   - 6 acceptance scenarios covering empty state, adding todos, validation, success/error feedback
   - Independent test: Can view list and add todos without any other features
   - Delivers immediate value for task tracking

2. **User Story 2 - Toggle Todo Completion (P2)**: Task management workflow
   - 5 acceptance scenarios for checkbox toggling with optimistic updates
   - Independent test: Create todo, toggle completion, verify persistence
   - Adds value but not blocking for MVP

3. **User Story 3 - Edit Todo Description (P3)**: Convenience feature
   - 5 acceptance scenarios for inline editing, validation, rollback
   - Independent test: Create, edit, save, verify change persists
   - Nice to have but users can delete/recreate as workaround

4. **User Story 4 - Delete Todo (P3)**: Cleanup functionality
   - 5 acceptance scenarios for delete with confirmation dialog
   - Independent test: Create, delete with confirmation, verify removal
   - Useful but not essential for initial task management

5. **User Story 5 - Loading and Error States (P1)**: UX feedback (P1 - Essential for MVP)
   - 5 acceptance scenarios for skeleton loaders, loading buttons, error messages
   - Independent test: Throttle network and verify feedback appears
   - Critical for professional feel and accessibility

**Requirements Generated**:
- 20 functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-020) covering all CRUD operations, validation, error handling, and UI components
- 1 key entity (Todo) with attributes matching backend API structure
- 10 success criteria with measurable metrics (2 seconds load time, 1 second add response, 200ms optimistic update, 320px-1920px responsive range)

**Edge Cases Identified** (7 total):
- Description > 500 characters validation
- Page refresh during edit (state loss)
- Multiple browser tabs (independent operation)
- Malformed backend responses
- Race conditions (toggle on deleted todo)
- Slow confirmation dialog rendering
- Mobile touch interactions

**Assumptions Documented** (12 total):
- Backend API at localhost:8000 following feature 001 spec
- No authentication or multi-user support
- Single page app (no routing)
- Modern browser support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, etc.)
- No local storage or caching
- No real-time sync across tabs
- ShadCN components provide WCAG 2.1 AA baseline

**Constraints Applied** (14 total):
- MUST use Next.js 14+ App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, ShadCN/UI
- MUST centralize API calls in lib/api.ts
- MUST NOT implement auth, multi-lists, real-time sync, state management libraries
- MUST be responsive and mobile-friendly

**Out of Scope** (19 items): Auth, user accounts, sharing, dark mode toggle, keyboard shortcuts, drag-drop, categories, due dates, rich text, attachments, search, filtering, bulk operations, undo/redo, deployment config, analytics, i18n

**Validation Checklist**:
- Created requirements.md checklist with 14 quality checks
- All checks PASSED (no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers, all requirements testable, success criteria measurable and technology-agnostic)
- Specification ready for planning phase

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete frontend specification with 5 prioritized, independently testable user stories (26 acceptance scenarios), 20 functional requirements, 10 measurable success criteria, and comprehensive edge cases/assumptions/constraints
- 🧪 Tests: No code tests (specification artifact) - Each user story includes detailed acceptance test scenarios and independent test descriptions
- 📁 Files: Created specs/002-frontend-todo-ui/spec.md (214 lines), specs/002-frontend-todo-ui/checklists/requirements.md (validation checklist - all 14 checks passed)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.plan` to create implementation plan for Next.js 14 + ShadCN/UI frontend, or run `/sp.clarify` if any requirements need further clarification (though none identified)
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification successfully balances comprehensive detail with technology-agnostic requirements. User stories prioritized for MVP-first delivery (P1: View/Add + Loading/Error = immediate value). All success criteria measurable without implementation knowledge. Clear separation between business requirements (FRs) and technical constraints. Zero clarifications needed - user provided detailed input allowing informed defaults. Ready for planning phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - specification completed with all validation checks passing
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Content Quality - PASS (no implementation in requirements), Requirement Completeness - PASS (zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers, all testable), Feature Readiness - PASS (all FRs map to acceptance scenarios), Success Criteria - PASS (measurable and technology-agnostic)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (standard specification workflow)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to planning phase with `/sp.plan` to design Next.js 14 architecture, component structure, and ShadCN/UI integration strategy
