## Prompt

User invoked `/sp.tasks` command (via workflow-orchestrator message) to generate detailed task breakdown for Frontend Todo UI feature.

**Context from workflow-orchestrator**:
```
Use frontend-agent to generate sp.tasks from the approved sp.plan for the Next.js + ShadCN/UI frontend.
```

**Input**: Complete design documents from `specs/002-frontend-todo-ui/`:
- spec.md (5 user stories with priorities: P1, P2, P3)
- plan.md (phases A-I, technical context, constitution check)
- research.md (8 technical decisions documented)
- component-hierarchy.md (8 components with responsibilities)
- api-design.md (4 API functions with types)
- quickstart.md (setup + 26+ test scenarios)

**Requirements**:
- Generate tasks.md organized by user story for independent implementation
- Follow strict checklist format: `- [ ] T### [P?] [Story?] Description with file path`
- Organize by phases: Setup → Foundational (BLOCKING) → User Stories (P1 → P2 → P3) → Polish → Validation
- Each user story phase must be independently testable
- Identify MVP scope (P1 stories only)
- Include parallel opportunities
- Mark dependencies clearly

## Response snapshot

Successfully generated comprehensive tasks.md with 28 tasks organized across 9 phases for Frontend Todo UI implementation:

**Task Organization** - By Phase and User Story:

**Phase 1: Setup (6 tasks)** - T001-T006
- T001: Initialize Next.js 14 project in frontend/ directory
- T002: Install and configure ShadCN/UI with CLI

**Phase 2: Foundational (2 tasks)** - T007-T008 ⚠️ CRITICAL PATH
- T007: [P] Create TypeScript types in frontend/types/todo.ts (Todo, CreateTodoRequest, UpdateTodoRequest, ApiError)
- T008: Implement API client in frontend/lib/api.ts (fetchTodos, createTodo, updateTodo, deleteTodo)
- **⚠️ BLOCKS ALL USER STORIES** - Must complete before any story work

**Phase 3: User Story 5 - Loading & Error States (P1)** - T009-T010 🎯 MVP Component
- T009: [P] [US5] Implement LoadingSkeleton component in frontend/components/loading-skeleton.tsx
- T010: [US5] Configure Toaster provider in frontend/app/layout.tsx and implement error handling utilities

**Phase 4: User Story 1 - View and Add Todos (P1)** - T011-T017 🎯 MVP Core
- T011: [P] [US1] Implement EmptyState component in frontend/components/empty-state.tsx
- T012: [P] [US1] Implement TodoForm component in frontend/components/todo-form.tsx (validation, character counter)

**Phase 6: User Story 3 - Edit Description (P3)** - T020-T021
- T020: [US3] Implement edit mode in TodoItem component with inline editing and keyboard shortcuts
- T021: [US3] Test User Story 3: Enter edit mode, save changes, cancel edit, test validation
- **Independent Test**: Create todo, edit description, save, verify change persists

**Phase 7: User Story 4 - Delete Todo (P3)** - T022-T023
- T022: [US4] Implement delete confirmation dialog in TodoItem using AlertDialog component
- T023: [US4] Test User Story 4: Click delete, verify dialog, cancel, confirm deletion
- **Independent Test**: Create todo, delete with confirmation, verify removal from list

**Phase 8: Responsive Design & Polish (3 tasks)** - T024-T026
- T024: [P] Add responsive Tailwind classes to all components (mobile-first approach)
- T025: Test responsive design on mobile (320px), tablet (768px), desktop (1920px)
- T026: Verify accessibility (focus states, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, touch targets 44px)

**Phase 9: Validation & Testing (2 tasks)** - T027-T028
- T027: Run complete end-to-end workflow test per quickstart.md (all 26+ scenarios)
- T028: Verify all 10 success criteria from spec.md are met

**Task Format Compliance** - ✅ ALL TASKS FOLLOW REQUIRED FORMAT:
```
- [ ] T### [P?] [Story?] Description with exact file path
```

**MVP Scope Identified** - 🎯 **21 tasks** (Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4):
- Setup (6 tasks) + Foundational (2 tasks) + US5 Loading/Error (2 tasks) + US1 View/Add (7 tasks) + CORS (1 task) + Testing (3 tasks)
- Delivers: View todos, add todos, loading states, error handling, empty state, toast notifications
- Estimated effort: 6-10 hours for MVP
- Full implementation: 12-20 hours total

**Parallel Opportunities Identified** - 8 tasks marked [P]:
- Phase 1: T004 + T005 (install ShadCN components in parallel)
- Phase 2: T007 (types - independent of API client initially)
- Phase 4: T011 + T012 + T013 + T014 (create components in parallel before integration in T015)
- Phase 4: T016 (backend CORS - can be done by backend developer in parallel)
- Phase 8: T024 (responsive classes - can be done while testing)

**Dependencies & Execution Order** - Clear critical path:
```
Phase 1 (Setup)
    ↓
Phase 2 (Foundational) ⚠️ CRITICAL - BLOCKS ALL STORIES
    ↓
Phase 3 (US5) + Phase 4 (US1) → MVP checkpoint
    ↓
Phase 5 (US2) → Can reorder
    ↓
Phase 6 (US3) + Phase 7 (US4) → Can reorder
    ↓
Phase 8 (Polish)
    ↓
Phase 9 (Validation)
```

**User Story Independence** - ✅ Each story independently testable:
- US1: Can test create/view without other features
- US2: Can test toggle without edit/delete
- US3: Can test edit without delete
- US4: Can test delete without edit
- US5: Can test loading/error states throughout

**Implementation Strategy Included**:
1. **MVP First**: Complete Phase 1-4 (US1 + US5) = 21 tasks
2. **Incremental Delivery**: Add P2 features (US2), then P3 features (US3+US4)
3. **Parallel Team Strategy**: Multiple developers can work on components simultaneously in Phase 4
4. **Checkpoint Testing**: Test independently after each user story phase completion

**Additional Sections Generated**:
- Task Count Summary: 28 total, breakdown by phase, MVP scope highlighted
- Implementation Notes: Code standards, folder structure, commit messages, constitution compliance
- Reference Documentation: Links to all design artifacts (spec, plan, research, component-hierarchy, api-design, quickstart)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created comprehensive tasks.md with 28 actionable tasks organized across 9 phases, following strict checklist format (checkbox + ID + story label + file paths). Each user story independently testable. MVP clearly identified (21 tasks). 8 parallel opportunities marked. Critical path documented. Ready for immediate implementation.
- 🧪 Tests: No code tests (manual testing only per spec requirements) - Each user story phase includes test task with acceptance criteria referencing quickstart.md's 26+ test scenarios. US1 test (T017), US2 test (T019), US3 test (T021), US4 test (T023), responsive test (T025), E2E test (T027), success criteria validation (T028)
- 📁 Files: Created specs/002-frontend-todo-ui/tasks.md (28 tasks with detailed purpose, files, implementation notes, validation, acceptance criteria, and references to design documents)
- 🔁 Next prompts: Run `/sp.implement` to execute implementation workflow starting with Phase 1 (Setup), or begin manual implementation starting with T001 (Initialize Next.js project), or review tasks.md for completeness before proceeding
- 🧠 Reflection: Task generation successfully translated design artifacts into executable implementation plan. All 28 tasks follow required checklist format with exact file paths. Foundational phase (T007-T008) correctly identified as critical blocking path for all user stories. User story phases enable independent testing and incremental delivery. MVP scope (21 tasks) clearly marked for prioritization. Parallel opportunities identified for team optimization. Each task includes enough detail for autonomous implementation while referencing comprehensive design documents. Constitution principles maintained throughout (layer separation, centralized API, component-based architecture). Ready for implementation phase.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all 28 tasks generated successfully with required format, all phases organized correctly, all dependencies documented
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): Format Compliance - PASS (all tasks have checkbox + ID + story label + file path), User Story Organization - PASS (5 stories mapped to phases 3-7), Independent Testing - PASS (each story has test criteria), MVP Identification - PASS (21 tasks clearly marked), Parallel Opportunities - PASS (8 tasks marked [P] with valid justification), Critical Path - PASS (Phase 2 foundational blocks all stories)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A (standard task generation workflow)
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to implementation phase with `/sp.implement` to execute Phase 1 (Setup) tasks T001-T006, establishing Next.js project foundation and ShadCN/UI integration before foundational and user story work
