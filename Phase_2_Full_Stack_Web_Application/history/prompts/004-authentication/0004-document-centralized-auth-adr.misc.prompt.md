## Prompt

workflow-orchestrator: Yes, an architectural decision was made. Run /sp.adr centralized-fetch-auth Document the decision: 'Centralized Auth Interceptor in API Client Fetch Wrapper'

## Response snapshot

Documents the ADR for the Centralized Auth Interceptor in `history/adr/0001-centralized-auth-interceptor.md`, detailing the decision to consolidate all fetch calls into a single utility that automatically handles JWT injection from localStorage.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: High - Permanent documentation of API client security architecture.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: Created history/adr/0001-centralized-auth-interceptor.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Phase 6: Implement Frontend Auth UI
- 🧠 Reflection: Consolidating these choices into ADRs early prevents "why did we do this?" questions during frontend expansion.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial create-adr.sh call missed --title flag.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): ADR Review Complete (PASS)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to Phase 6 UI components.
