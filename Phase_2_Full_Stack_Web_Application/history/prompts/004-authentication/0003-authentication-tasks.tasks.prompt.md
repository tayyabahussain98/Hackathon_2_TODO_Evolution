## Response snapshot

Generated tasks.md for Better Auth authentication with 66 tasks across 9 phases.

**Phase Distribution**:
- Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003) - 3 tasks
- Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T011) - 8 tasks (BLOCKS all user stories)
- Phase 3: User Story 1 - Email/Password Auth (T012-T017) - 6 tasks (MVP core)
- Phase 4: User Story 3 - Protected Routes (T018-T032) - 15 tasks
- Phase 5: Database Migration (T033-T034) - 2 tasks
- Phase 6: User Story 4 - Protected Frontend (T035-T044) - 10 tasks
- Phase 7: User Story 5 - User-Specific Todos (T045-T048) - 4 tasks (validation only)
- Phase 8: User Story 2 - Google OAuth (T049-T055) - 7 tasks
- Phase 9: Polish (T056-T066) - 11 tasks (testing)

**Total**: 66 tasks

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- T001-T002: Backend and frontend dependency installation
- T005-T007: All model creation (User, SessionToken, auth Pydantic)
- T012-T013: Auth service and JWT service
- T035-T037: Token storage, context, hook
- T038-T040: Login, signup, logout pages
- T049, T052-T053: OAuth backend and frontend
- T056-T066: All manual testing

**MVP Scope**: User Stories 1 + 3 + 4 (T001-T044, plus T033-T034 for migration) = ~44 tasks for complete email/password auth with protected routes and frontend.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Comprehensive task breakdown for Better Auth authentication feature with 66 tasks organized by user story
- 🧪 Tests: Manual testing tasks (T056-T066) for all flows
- 📁 Files: Created specs/004-authentication/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute implementation
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user story following Spec-Driven Development. MVP is US1+US3+US4 (email/password + protected routes + protected frontend). US2 (OAuth) is P2 and can be added after MVP. US5 is validation only since ownership checks implemented in US3. All tasks follow checklist format with IDs, [P] markers, [Story] labels, and file paths.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A (task generation phase)
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to /sp.implement
